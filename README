# 🤖 AutoUI Tester

### 🧠 Intelligent Web UI & Performance Testing Framework  
*Created by Dawid Cierbikowski*

AutoUI Tester is a modular Playwright-based framework for **automatic exploration, performance auditing, accessibility scanning, and reporting** of any web application.

This tool can crawl entire websites, collect key metrics, capture screenshots, and generate a clean **HTML report** — all without writing extra test scripts.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Smart Explorer
- Discovers internal links up to a configurable depth  
- Collects **page titles**, **URLs**, and **HTTP statuses**  
- Captures **screenshots** for every visited page  
- Detects **console errors** and **failed requests**  

### ⚡ Performance Analysis
Powered by `PerformanceService`, it measures:

| Metric | Description | Rating |
|--------|------------|--------|
| ⏱️ Load Time | Total time until full page load | 🟢 Fast / 🟡 Medium / 🔴 Slow |
| 🧩 DOMContentLoaded | Time to DOM readiness | 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 |
| ⚙️ TTFB | Time To First Byte | 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 |

### ♿ Accessibility Auditing
`AccessibilityService` uses [axe-core/playwright](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm) to:
- Check **WCAG 2.1 compliance**  
- Detect **missing alt attributes**, **contrast issues**, **ARIA violations**  
- Return structured accessibility issues per page  

### 🧠 AI-like Smart Exploration (Experimental)
`SmartExplorerService` heuristically:
- Identifies **key pages** like Login, Contact, Products  
- Simulates user paths  
- Avoids repetitive or external links intelligently  

### 🧾 Reporting
`Reporter` generates:
- **HTML reports** (`reports/report.html`)  
- **JSON logs** (`reports/logs.json`)  
- Includes screenshots, console logs, performance, and accessibility data

## 🧱 Extend the Framework

You can add:

- **Visual Regression Testing** → compare screenshots across runs  
- **SEO Audits** → extract meta tags, headings, and links  
- **Security Checks** → detect mixed content or HTTP-only cookies  
- **CI/CD Integration** → export results to Slack, GitHub, or Jenkins

## 🧠 Future Roadmap

- AI-based auto form filling  
- Multi-device & responsive mode testing  
- Trend analytics with performance history  
- Lighthouse integration  
- Smart navigation learning
